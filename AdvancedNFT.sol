// Implements a merkle tree airdrop where addresses in the tree are allowed to mint once.
// - hint: merkle leaf should be a hash of the address and its index in the bitmap
// use bitmaps from OZ

// Use commit reveal to allocate NFT ids randomly. The reveal should be 10 blocks ahead of the commit.
// - look at cool cats NFT to see how this is done (they use chainlink, you should use commit reveal)

// Add multicall to the NFT so people can transfer several NFTs in one transaction (make sure people canâ€™t abuse minting!)
